Pandas Features Used So Far

read_csv()
Loads data from a CSV file into Python as a structured table (DataFrame).

DataFrame object
The main Pandas data structure that stores rows and columns like an Excel sheet.

.columns check
Used to verify whether a particular column exists in the DataFrame before performing operations.

groupby()
Groups the data based on one or more columns to perform calculations on each group.

size()
After grouping, counts how many rows are present in each group.

unstack(fill_value=0)
Converts grouped results into a pivot-table format, replacing missing combinations with 0.

Iterating with .items()
Helps loop through summary results (like dictionaries) to print status and their counts.
